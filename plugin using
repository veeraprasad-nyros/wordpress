 Where username is the twitter username Ex: veeraprasad1989
       tweet_reset_time is the refreshing time for redisplaying the twittes. It is in seconds.
       num_tweets is the how many tweets you want to display.
       show_tweets by default false. If you want to see the tweets then use the true.
       You also place the content between the open and closing tags.
       Ex: [twitts username='' show_tweets='true']Follow me[/twitts]
       By default it displays the 'Follow veeraprasad1989 on Twitter'
